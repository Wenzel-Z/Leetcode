"""
Basically the same as House Robber 1 but done twice to account for different starting points.
Since the last house is the neighbor of the first house, we go through the array twice, one which hits the 
very first house but excludes the last house. The other which starts on the second house but hits the very last house.
After setting up those parameters, proceed as normal like in House Robber 1. 

Time = O(n) linear dp. Iterate through the array once. Technically O(2n) ðŸ¤“
Space = O(n) for the two extra arrays. Technically O(2n)
