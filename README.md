The study guide has problem lists from these lists:
* [Blind75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)
* [NeetCode150](https://neetcode.io) (which is an extension of Blind75)
* [Sean Prashad Leetcode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)

* Extra problems practice recommended by me

Currently support languages:
* Java
* C#

Make sure you have these framework installed:

   - Level 1: Easy Array and Hashing, and Two Pointers and Easy Stack
   - Level 1.5: The rest of Array and Hashing and Two Pointers
   - Level 2: Binary Search and Sliding Window. These two are specialization of Two Pointers
   - Level 2.5: Rest of Stack
2. **Intermediate**
   -Level 2.5: Linked List
   -Level 3a: Trees
   -Level 3.5a: Backtracking
   -Level 3.6a: 1-D Dynamic Programming and Graphs (lots of Backtracking)
   -Level 3b: Bit Manipulation
   -Level 3c: Math and Geometry 
3. **Advanced**
   -Level 4a: Heap/Priority Queue
   -Level 4b: Intervals
   -Level 4c: Greedy
   -Level 5a: 2-D Dynamic Programming

Starting from Intermediate Level, you can explore everything from that list and do not have to go in order. But you should do the Beginner category in order to learn the fundamentals.
